<p>I am presently working as a Deep Learning Researcher at a startup company CVEDIA. Well, we are as fun a company as it can get, to start with, we are 30 people from 18 different countries. I handle the Deep Learning research at CVEDIA. Researching on how to bridge the gap between the synthetic data and real data, have worked on different senor modularity and network quantization and optimization.<br/>
Previously, I worked with Predible Health as Deep Learning Scientist (who am I kidding, I was an Engineer, Scientist just looks good on the job-letter). I worked on the the research and development of Predible's core Imaging platform wherein I built state of the art vessel segmentation algorithms/models (till date, one of my proudest work). Head over to my resume for some more details.<br/>

An avid speaker, I love the open-source community and spreading the little knowledge that I have. I have been speaker at different conferences namely MuPy, PyCon, DataHack Submit, IIT-Bombay tech fest, Kongu University, SMVDU and a few more.</p>

<h3> The personal me </h3>
<p>Born in Jharkhand, India, brought-up/studies/been to almost all across the country. The cliche tech guy, I said cliche because you would usually find me with my Laptop with headphones on.
A huge sports fan, I watch everything and play a few, an Athlete, a Real Madrid F.C follower.
In love with the mountains, if you want to explore some trail, hit me up. <br/>
Current Out of work Mission/Ambition: To build a tiny house in the Himalayan ranges.</p>
