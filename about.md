<p>Hello there! I am a deep learning researcher with over 6 years of experience building cutting-edge deep learning products and scaling startups. I have successfully led teams from ideation to production, bridging the gap between scientific concepts and practical implementation.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in working with diverse teams, motivating and empowering them to achieve success. I possess technical expertise in deep 2D/3D networks, sensor modalities, network quantization, and optimization, which has helped me deliver state-of-the-art products that push the boundaries of deep learning.

In addition to my technical prowess, I am committed to sharing knowledge and mentoring the next generation of deep learning experts. I believe in inspiring and educating others, which is why I have launched a personal website where I can share my experiences and insights with the world.

I take pride in my creativity, precision, and attention to detail, which are essential qualities that have helped me deliver exceptional results consistently. My passion for innovation and my unwavering dedication to my craft have earned me a reputation as a force to be reckoned with in the world of AI.

I look forward to continuing my work in the field of deep learning and to making an impact in the lives of people around the world.</p>

<p>I was the founding enginner at London based startup, Sylvera, I was one of the first employee and helped developed products for ARR, IFM and REDD frameworks.<br/>

Previously, I worked with CVEDIA, handling the Deep Learning Research for them and before that at Predible Health as Deep Learning Scientist (who am I kidding, I was an Engineer, Scientist just looks good on the job-letter). I worked on the the research and development of Predible's core Imaging platform wherein I built state of the art vessel segmentation algorithms/models (till date, one of my proudest work). Head over to my resume for some more details.<br/>

An avid speaker, I love the open-source community and spreading the little knowledge that I have. I have been speaker at different conferences namely MuPy, PyCon, DataHack Submit, IIT-Bombay tech fest, Kongu University, SMVDU and a few more.</p>

<h3> The personal me </h3>
<p>Born in Jharkhand, India, brought-up/studies/been to almost all across the country. The cliche tech guy, I said cliche because you would usually find me with my Laptop with headphones on.
A huge sports fan, I watch everything and play a few, an Athlete, a Real Madrid F.C follower.
In love with the mountains, if you want to explore some trail, hit me up. <br/>
Current Out of work Mission/Ambition: To build a tiny house in the Himalayan ranges.</p>
